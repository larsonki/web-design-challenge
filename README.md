**Click [here](https://larsonki.github.io/web-design-challenge/) to access the landing page.**

In this assignment, images and data were used from a previous project to create a dashboard describing the visualizations and statistical trends.

The images and data were obtained through an API using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Website Requirements:
1. A landing page containing the following elements:
   - An explanation of the project
   - Links to each visualizations page. The landing page should also include a sidebar containing image previews that are also links to the page for that visualization.
2. Four visualization pages, stored in their own folder locally. Each contains the following elements:
   - A descriptive title and heading tab.
   - The plot for the selected comparison. The images displayed should be stored in their own folder locally.
3. A "Comparison" page that does the following:
   - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can easily be compared to one another.
   - Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
     - The grid must be two plots across medium and large screens, and one plot across on extra-small and small screens.
4. A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
   - The table must be a Bootstrap table component.
   - The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML or by converting it to HTML.
5. At the top of each page, the website must have a navigation menu containing the following:
   - Name of the site on the left side.
   - A dropdown menu labeled "Plots" to access each visualization.
   - Links to the "Data" & "Comparison" pages.
   - It should be responsive (using media queries to change the color of the bar for small screens).
